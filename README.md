# Extracting Stock News Sentiment in a Pandas DataFrame

## Description
In this repository I utilitze Financial Modeling Prep's API to import news articles and use BeautifulSoup to extract the text from their HTML output, clean up the data, generate sentiment data, and build a Pandas dataframe which counts how much positive, negative, opinion, or facts there are from the given text and groups it by stock.
